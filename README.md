# Donut Website UI/UX Design 🍩

## Overview
This project is a UI/UX design case study for a donut website created using Figma.
The focus of this project is to explore visual design, consistency, and user-friendly layouts
by designing different donut variants.

## Project Goal
To create visually appealing donut screens that maintain consistency in layout while using
color theory and visual hierarchy to highlight different flavors.

## Donut Screens
- Strawberry Donut
- Blueberry Donut
- Chocolate Donut

Each screen represents a different donut flavor while following the same design structure
to ensure consistency and clarity.

## Design Process
1. Understanding the design objective
2. Creating structured layouts
3. Applying color theory for each flavor
4. Designing high-fidelity UI screens
5. Creating a clickable prototype in Figma

## Tools Used
- Figma
- Wireframing
- Prototyping
- Color theory
- Visual hierarchy

## Learnings
- Improved understanding of color theory for food branding
- Learned how to maintain UI consistency across multiple screens
- Gained hands-on experience with Figma prototyping

## Future Improvements
- Add user flow between donut screens
- Conduct basic user testing
- Improve accessibility and contrast
